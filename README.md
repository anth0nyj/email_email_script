# Python Email Script

### A simple script for sending emails from the command line.

This is just a simple Python script I wrote for fun that serves the purpose of sending emails from the command line.

##### Current Features
* You can log into your GMail account.
* You can send emails from your GMail account.
* You can save your login credentials to avoid having to enter them for each email.

##### Usage
1. Open your preferred terminal emulator.
2. Change into the appropriate directory.
3. Run `python interactive_emailer.py`.
4. Follow the prompts.

##### Requirements
* Python
  * I'm running Python 3.7.2, but I believe this will run fine on Python 2.7.
* Terminal Emulator
  * I use (and strongly recommend) [iTerm](https://iterm2.com/).
